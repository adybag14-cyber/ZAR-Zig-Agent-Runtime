# FS5.7 i386 CPU Architecture Support

## Scope

Start `FS5.7` with a real bounded `i386` freestanding lane, without falsely claiming full 32-bit parity for the existing `x86_64` driver/runtime matrix.

## Delivered Slices

### Slice 1: i386 Build and Boot Proof
- `build.zig` now emits a second freestanding artifact:
  - `zig build baremetal-i386`
  - output: `zig-out/bin/openclaw-zig-baremetal-i386.elf`
- new 32-bit bootstrap path:
  - `scripts/baremetal/i386_boot.S`
  - `scripts/baremetal/i386_lld.ld`
- new validation:
  - `scripts/baremetal-i386-smoke-check.ps1`
  - `scripts/baremetal-qemu-i386-smoke-check.ps1`
- hosted CI and `release-preview` now execute both i386 checks.

### Slice 2: i386 Descriptor and Runtime-Safe Bootstrap Parity

- `src/baremetal/x86_bootstrap.zig` now carries additive dual-arch descriptor layout support:
  - runtime `IDT` entry layout is now `8` bytes on `x86` and `16` bytes on `x86_64`
  - runtime descriptor-pointer base width is now `u32` on `x86` and `u64` on `x86_64`
  - descriptor-load telemetry now accepts both `x86` and `x86_64` freestanding runtime arches
- `src/baremetal/vga_text_console.zig` now treats both `x86` and `x86_64` freestanding guests as hardware-backed VGA text targets
- `src/baremetal_main.zig` now treats both `x86` and `x86_64` freestanding guests as valid `pause`, `cli`/`sti`, and QEMU debug-console targets
- `scripts/baremetal-i386-smoke-check.ps1` now validates the emitted i386 ELF symbol table for descriptor exports:
  - `oc_gdtr_ptr`
  - `oc_idtr_ptr`
  - `oc_gdt_ptr`
  - `oc_idt_ptr`
  - `oc_descriptor_tables_ready`
  - `oc_descriptor_tables_loaded`
  - `oc_try_load_descriptor_tables`

## What This Proves

- the freestanding runtime builds for `x86-freestanding-none`
- the emitted artifact is `ELF32`
- the artifact keeps the required Multiboot2 header
- the artifact carries the PVH ELF note required by the current direct QEMU `-kernel` path
- `qemu-system-i386` boots the artifact far enough to reach `baremetalStart()` and exit through the existing `isa-debug-exit` smoke path
- the x86 bootstrap/descriptor export seam is no longer implicitly hard-coded to `x86_64`
- the i386 artifact exports the descriptor telemetry/control symbols required by the existing bare-metal ABI surface
- the i386 freestanding runtime now has additive support for QEMU debug-console writes, interrupt enable/disable toggles, and VGA text console hardware access

## Current Boundary

- this is build/boot smoke plus additive descriptor/bootstrap/runtime parity
- it is not yet full 32-bit driver/runtime parity
- no live `i386` NIC/storage/display probe lanes are claimed yet
- descriptor telemetry is now dual-arch, but the broader descriptor/mailbox live proof lane is still only claimed on the existing `x86_64` PVH artifact
- most freestanding drivers and subsystem probes are still intentionally gated to `x86_64`

## Next Steps

1. classify each freestanding subsystem into:
   - already 32-bit-safe
   - safe after guard widening
   - still blocked on `x86_64` assumptions
2. ship the first bounded live `i386` subsystem proof beyond smoke
3. decide the first real `i386` hardware proof lane in order:
   - serial / QEMU debug
   - VGA / framebuffer
   - storage
   - NIC
